# Diabetic_Retinopathy-detection-using-DeepLearningTechnologies
Diabetic retinopathy is a disease caused by chronic diabetes and can cause blindness. Therefore early detection of diabetic retinopathy is essential to prevent the increased severity. An automated system can help detect diabetic retinopathy quickly for determining the follow-up treatment to avoid further damage to the retina.This project presents detection using three deeplearning technologies like DenseNet-169,Conv-lstm
and Dense-lstm. From the results obtained 94 percentage accuracy for Densenet-169 model, 99 percentage accuracy for ConvLSTM (proposed model)and 83 percentage accuracy for Dense-LSTM (proposed hybrid model).
